                       Adknown is a web publishing and online marketing company, based in Guelph, Ontario. My involvment at Adknown was on the
                      development team. The development team at Adknown works on developing and maintaing software used by the marketing team,
                      and the game development team, as well as many now not so small side-projects.

                      During my time at Adknown I worked as a Software Engineer.  In this role I was given the opportunity to work on a large number of projects.
                      <br>
                       Every Monday morning I participated in the developer meeting, where all of the developers would attend (word this better).
                      In this meeting each developer would discuss what they had worked on in the previous week, any issues, questions, or cool
                      findings that came along the way, and what they were planning to work on the next week. I felt that these meetings were a
                      really great way to keep everyone on the developer team in tune with what was happening in the company. Often during or shortly
                      after developer meetings other developers would ask to speak to me about new tools that I was using, in order to see if they
                      would be appropriate for their own project requirements.

                      During my work terms I had several goals.  
                      <br>
                      One of my goals even before coming to Adknown was to learn more about different AWS services and how to effictively utilize them.
                      Since Adknown has identified the value in using AWS, I have accomplished this goal.  In fact, I was even able to learn and use a new AWS tool called Step Functions, and introduce this technology to our company during our weekly meeting.
                      <br>
                      Another goal that I had this semester was to improve my web development skills.  Although I had previous experience in web-development before working at Adknown, I feel that this experience has helped my to take a more organized approach to web-development.
